              <h2>About Matt Smith</h2>
              <p>
                <span class="firstcharacter">M</span>atthew Robert Smith (born 28 October 1982) is an English actor. He is best known for his roles as the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in the BBC series Doctor Who (2010–2013), Daemon Targaryen in the HBO series House of the Dragon (2022–present) and Prince Philip in the Netflix series The Crown (2016–2017), the latter of which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. <br>
                <br> Smith initially aspired to be a professional footballer, but spondylolysis forced him out of the sport. After joining the National Youth Theatre and studying drama and creative writing at the University of East Anglia, he became an actor in 2003, performing in plays including Murder in the Cathedral, Fresh Kills, The History Boys and On the Shore of the Wide World in London theatres. Extending his repertoire into West End theatre, he has since performed in the stage adaptation of Swimming with Sharks with Christian Slater, followed a year later by a critically acclaimed performance as Henry in That Face. <br>
                <br> Smith's first television role came in 2006 as Jim Taylor in the BBC adaptations of Philip Pullman's The Ruby in the Smoke and The Shadow in the North, while his first major role in television came as Danny in the 2007 BBC series Party Animals. Smith portrayed the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in Doctor Who from 2010 to 2013, becoming the youngest person to portray the character. In film, he portrayed a dual role in Womb (2010), the physical forms of Skynet in Terminator Genisys (2015), 1960s pimp Jack in Last Night in Soho (2021), and Milo in Morbius (2022).

        <!-- The Matt Smith Timeline. -->

        <!-- For this part I actually followed a tutorial, as I knew how I wanted it to
          look, but was just 100% sure of the execution.  The tutorial was quite
          lengthy.  Also, this matter was being touched on in my external bootcamp as
          well.  If given some more time I would have continued with this as it is not
          100% pixel perfect, which will probably only drive me crazy and nobody else,
          but I see those few pixels and they will forever haunt my dreams. -->
